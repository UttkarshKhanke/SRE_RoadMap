ðŸ“œ History and Evolution of SRE (Short Summary)
2003 â€“ Google Invents SRE:
The concept of Site Reliability Engineering was created at Google by Ben Treynor Sloss, a software engineer who was tasked with leading operations. He described SRE as "what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team."

Problem It Solved:
Traditional Ops teams couldnâ€™t keep up with the scale and speed of changes in modern software. Google wanted engineers to apply coding principles to manage systems more reliably and automatically.

Core Idea:
Use software engineering to solve operations problems like downtime, scaling, monitoring, and reliability â€” rather than relying on manual work.

2016 â€“ Google Shares the Concept:
Google published the "Site Reliability Engineering" book (aka the SRE Book), making the practice public. It became an industry reference.

Post-2016 â€“ Industry Adoption:
Companies like Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, LinkedIn, Microsoft started adopting SRE principles. The role of "SRE" became mainstream.

Today:
SRE is now a critical discipline in modern DevOps and cloud-native ecosystems, helping businesses build scalable, resilient, and highly available systems.
