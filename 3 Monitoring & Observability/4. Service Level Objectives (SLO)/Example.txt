📏 Example
Let’s say your SLI is:

"Percentage of successful HTTP requests over the last 30 days"

Then, your SLO might be:

"99.9% of requests must succeed over a 30-day rolling window"

If you served 1,000,000 requests in 30 days, your SLO permits:

Up to 1,000 requests to fail before breaching the objective
