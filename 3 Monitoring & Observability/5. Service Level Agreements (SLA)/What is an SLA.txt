ðŸ“„ Service Level Agreements (SLA)
ðŸ“Œ What is an SLA?
A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal contract or agreement between a service provider and a customer that outlines the guaranteed level of service and the penalties or remedies if those guarantees are not met.

It is legally or financially binding, unlike SLOs or SLIs.
