👨‍💻 SRE Usage Example:
Let’s say users are reporting slow checkout on your e-commerce app:

Metrics show 99th percentile latency is rising on the /checkout endpoint.

Logs reveal errors like "Timeout when calling payment gateway".

Traces show the request spent 1.5 seconds on the payment service call, instead of 300ms.

Now you know what’s wrong, why it’s wrong, and where to fix it — thanks to all three pillars.
